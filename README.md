# ICMP-FLOODING-TOOL
This tool is an ICMP flooding utility designed to send a large volume of ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets to a specified target IP address. The flood of packets can potentially overwhelm the target, leading to slowed performance or service disruption. Use responsibly and only for authorized testing purposes.
